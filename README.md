"Yet Another Movie Database Application" 

This was an Android application I made during college and most of all it helped me getting the grasp of the basics in terms of programming for the Android framework.

The "visual part" of the app was not intended to be as good as it could be since I was more focused into developing a good application from the software development's point of view. 

The only thing I regret is the way I schedule the services that will later update the local storage. I don´t like the way its done but time is not always our friend. 

This app uses all the four components. It also allows the user to set some configurations. Down below there is a few images just so you can have a peek at the final result.
