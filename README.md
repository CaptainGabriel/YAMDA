# The return (refactoring) of Yamda

### "Yet Another Movie Database Application"

This was an Android application I made during college and most of all it helped me getting the grasp of the basics in terms of programming for the Android framework. Now I've come back to it in order to refactor it to the most updated patterns and best practices.

The "visual part" of the app was not intended to be as good but this is something I will also be improving through this refactoring series.
